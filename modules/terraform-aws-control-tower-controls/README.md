# AWS Control Tower Controls Module

> [!WARNING]
>
> ❌ Examples provided should NOT be considered a RECOMMENDATION or BEST PRACTICE for how Control Tower Controls should be structured or applied within your AWS ORGANIZATION.
>
> ⚡ Each ORGANIZATION should:
> 1. Carefully evaluate their SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
> 2. Chose Controls that align with their specific GOVERNANCE needs
> 3. Evaluate their COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
> 4. Ensure Controls will not cause unintentional disruption to existent workloads
> 5. Ensure Change Management processes are being followed
>
> Make sure before applying this module that your organization has processes in place to handle the above.

This module lets you apply [Control Tower Controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/introduction.html) to OUs. The module call looks like this:

```hcl
locals {
  # Map of OUs to be used for target so users
  # don't have to remember or look up the OU IDs
  ou_map = {
    "production_ou"   = "ou-qyyj-cuxntp0t" # test_ou1
    "sandbox_ou"   = "ou-qyyj-ads8zuff" # test_ou2
  }
}

module "controls" {
  source = "../../"

  map_ous_controls = {

    "sandbox_controls" = {
      ou_ids                       = [local.ou_map["sandbox_ou"]]
      strongly_recommended_controls = true
      elective_controls             = true
      data_residency_controls       = true
      individual_controls = [
        "8uk3vrotlr08jfb0cbxp5klbs"
      ]
    }

    "production_controls" = {
      ou_ids                       = [local.ou_map["production_ou"]]
      strongly_recommended_controls = true
      individual_controls = [
        "8uk3vrotlr08jfb0cbxp5klbs",
        "AWS-GR_SUBNET_AUTO_ASSIGN_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can choose to apply any of the `strongly_recommended_controls`, `elective_controls`, or `data_residency_controls`, as well as individual controls listed in [controlsList.tf](controlsList.tf) and documented in [The AWS Control Tower Controls Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/controls-reference.html).


To specify an arbitrary control by its API controlIdentifier (ARN), use the `individual_controls` property. The `individual_controls` can contain NAME or ID, as in the following example. You can also mix IDs and Names within the same block.

```
individual_controls = [
  "6rilu41n0gb9w6mxrkyewoer4",                      # Name: AWS-GR_RESTRICTED_SSH
  "AWS-GR_SUBNET_AUTO_ASSIGN_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED"    # ID: 50z1ot237wl8u1lv5ufau6qqo
]
```

> [!TIP]
>
> ⚡ You can use the `parallelism` flag to control the number of resources that are created in parallel. The default is 10, and if you're dealing with a lot of controls the execution can take a while. Example:
>
> `terraform apply -parallelism=30`
>
> Controls API currently supports up to 100 operations in parallel.

## Nested OU Levels

The [data.tf](data.tf) file contains mappings for OU IDs up to the 3rd level. See the commented Level 4 resource if you need that depth.

Example of OU depth:

```
Level 0:  Root (OU)
Level 1:  ├── Security
Level 1:  ├── AFT-Management
Level 1:  └── Production
Level 2:      ├── Prod-NVirginia
Level 2:      └── Prod-Ohio
Level 3:          └── Ohio-Infra
```

See the [examples/complete](examples/complete) directory for more information.
